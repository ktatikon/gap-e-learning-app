## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### Before (Zustand-based)
```
Frontend (React) → Zustand Store → Local Storage
```

### After (Supabase-powered)
```
Frontend (React) → React Query → Supabase API → PostgreSQL Database
                                ↓
                         Row Level Security
                                ↓
                         Real-time Subscriptions
```
